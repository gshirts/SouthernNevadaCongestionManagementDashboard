Weighted Base Impact:
The base impact weighted by speed differential, congestion or total delay - provide additional insight into the effects of bottlenecks on traffic in your area.

Speed Differential:
Base impact weighted by the difference between free-flow speed and observed speed. This metric should be used when you want to identify and rank bottlenecks from the individual vehicle perspective.

Congestion:
Base impact weighted by the measured speed as a percentage of free-flow speed. Similar to the speed differential metric, the congestion metric should be used when you want to identify and rank bottlenecks from the individual vehicle perspective.
NOTE: The term congestion is defined as "measured speed as a percent of the free-flow speed"

Total Delay:
Base impact weighted by the difference between free-flow speed and observed speed multiplied by the average daily volume (AADT). This metric should be used to rank and compare the estimated total delay from all vehicles within the bottleneck.
